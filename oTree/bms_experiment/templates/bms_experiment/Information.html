    You will now be presented with information regarding the Corona-Warn-App. This information gives you facts about the
    app, which are based on the publicly available source-code.
</p>
{% endif %}
<br>
<h4> What the app does while being active </h4>
<p>
    {% if tr == 'brief' %}
    The app will interchange pseudonymous data with nearby phones, which also have the app installed. This data cannot
    be used to expose the user’s identity.
    {% else %}
    Every user is given a <em>Temporary Exposure Key (TEK) </em>, which changes daily. With the help of this
    key, a pseudonymous identifier is derived, which is renewed every fifteen minutes. Using Bluetooth the app will
    interchange this identifier with nearby mobile phones. Interchanged identifiers will be saved locally for 14 days.
    The identifier of nearby users is the only data, which is <strong>collected</strong> by the app, meaning that it
    does not and can not collect any location data or any other personal data. Other than the user’s own regularly
    changing identifier the app does not <strong>provide</strong> any information to the outside world without their
    consent.
    {% endif %}
</p>
<h4> What data is stored </h4>
<p>
    {% if tr == 'brief' %}
    The only data that is stored on a central server is data, which contains pseudonymous information about someone, who
    got infected and voluntarily shared this information. This means no data, which can be traced back to the infected
    person, is stored. Later in the experiment you will be asked what the color is: the color is yellow.
    {% else %}
    The Corona-Warn-App is based on a decentralized approach. The only data, which is stored centrally on a server is a
    collection of keys, the rest of the data is kept on the user’s local device. This prevents any third-party from
    getting access to personal information. The keys on the centralized server are called Temporary Exposure Keys. They
    belong to the infected, who used the app and voluntarily decided to upload their key. These keys can not be traced
    back to the person, as they change daily and are only published in case of an infection (with consent). This implies
    that data concerning real names and location won’t be collected. Later in the experiment you will be asked what the
    color is: the color is yellow.
    {% endif %}
</p>

<h4> When warnings are given </h4>
<p>
    {% if tr == 'brief' %}
    If the user has the pseudonymous data from someone, who got infected and shared this information, the app proceeds
    through a multitude of steps (i.e. weighing time of exposure and distance) to determine the infection risk and
    updates the user about their risk score. They will not have the possibility to find out who the infected person is.
    {% else %}
    The warning functionality is provided, by comparing the list of publicly available Temporary Exposure Keys with the
    locally stored identifiers, which were interchanged with nearby smartphones. Because these identifiers were derived
    from the Temporary Exposure Key of their owner, it is possible to check whether a given identifier was derived from
    a given key. If any of the locally stored identifiers from the last 14 days was derived from a key in the public
    list of “infected” keys, the app proceeds through a multitude of steps (i.e. weighing time of exposure and distance)
    to determine the infection risk and updates the user about their risk score.
    {% endif %}
</p>
<h4> What happens when somebody is infected </h4>
<p>
    {% if tr == 'brief' %}
    When a user gets infected with the COVID-19 they will have the possibility to share this information to warn
    others. However, it is not possible to expose their identity, even if they decided to publicly share that they got
    infected.
    {% else %}
    When a user is infected with the COVID-19, they will be asked whether they want to publish their Temporary
    Exposure Keys of the last fourteen days. If and only if the user agrees, the keys are uploaded to the central
    server.
